Spent 2 weeks in Uganda with a friend who really knows Africa.
I went as her assistant and we went all over the country with an amazing guide.
One of the many highlights was a half days walk where we met up by chance with a group of women,
who really wouldn't talk much to us, until my friend mentioned something to me about her divorce
and they were shocked thinking that white women in the west didn't divorce
or even have men troubles but it opened the door for an incredible conversation about relationships
and the challenges they face as women in Uganda.
At that time, 2009, it was illegal to divorce for women but they had just legalized separation.
It was a pretty amazing opportunity for us to learn more about women in the country of Uganda.

Another trip I took was to Malaysia and Singapore. We did a ton of walking, and some amazing snorkeling.

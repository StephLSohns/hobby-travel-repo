Travel is a big one.
Trips used to be farther away and longer,
but since moving back to Colorado they are often wonderful 4 day get aways with close friends.
Retreats are also a way for me to get downtime and centered,
just did an all day one last Saturday 8:30-6:30pm in Kundalini yoga.
Also hiking, long walks.
Games -balderdash, cards, dixit, charades, etc. I love games and will play them anytime anywhere with anyone.
